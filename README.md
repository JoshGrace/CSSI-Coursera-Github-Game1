# CSSI-Github-practice

This Github repository holds a Capture the Flag game created for the CSSI-Coursera program It has two components, I’ve linked to some tutorials to help everyone get familiar with git basics and committing/ pushing. Then I’ve made a Github repo that will have each week’s CTF challenges. Here are a few tutorial links to get you started learning git:

There are 5 flags hidden throughout the week one folder of varying difficulties, which are designed to demonstrate the various basic functionalities of git. When you find a flag, please DM me on slack (@JoshGrace(TA)) so I can confirm it for you.
