PREFACE x \
\
THE steady advance towards completion of the great Oxford \
English Dictionary has made it possible for the Delegates of the \
Clarendon Press to authorize the preparation and issue of this book, \
which in its own province and on its own scale uses the materials and \
follows the methods by which the Oxford editors have revolution- \
ized lexicography. The book is designed as a dictionary, and not \
as an encyclopaedia ; that is, the uses of words and phrases as such \
are its subject matter, and it is concerned with giving information \
about the things for which those words and phrases stand only so \
far as correct use of the words depends upon knowledge of the \
things. The degree of this dependence varies greatly with the \
kind of word treated, the difference between cyclopaedic and dic- \
tionary treatment varies with it, and the line of distinction is \
accordingly a fluctuating and dubious one. It is to the endeavour to \
discern and keep to this line that we attribute whatever peculiarities \
we are conscious of in this dictionary as compared with others of the \
same size. One of these peculiarities is the large amount of space \
given to the common words that no one goes through the day with- \
out using scores or hundreds of times, often disposed of in a line or \
two on the ground that they are plain and simple and that every one \
knows all about them by the light of nature, but in fact entangled \
with other words in so many alliances and antipathies during their \
perpetual knocking about the world that the idiomatic use of them \
is far from easy ; chief among such words are the prepositions, the \
conjunctions, the pronouns, and such ' simple ' nouns and verbs as \
hand and way, go andpwf. Another peculiarity is the use, copious \
for so small a dictionary, of illustrative sentences as a necessary \
supplement to definition when a word has different senses between \
which the distinction is fine, or when a definition is obscure and \
unconvincing until exemplified ; these sentences often are, but still \
more often are not, quotations from standard authors; they are \
meant to establish the sense of the definition by appeal not to ex- \
ternal authority, but to the reader's own consciousness, and there- \
fore their source, even when authoritative, is not named. A third \
and a fourth peculiarity are the direct results of the preceding ones ; \
if common words are to be treated at length, and their uses to be \
copiously illustrated, space must be saved both by the curtest \
\

be found facing the letter A ; on the page before these remarks is a list of the abbrevia- \
tions used in the Dictionary. \

possible treatment of all that are either uncommon or fitter for the \
encyclopaedia than the dictionary, and by the severest economy of \
expression \'97 amounting to the adoption of telegraphese \'97 that readers \
can be expected to put up with. \
\
In attaching this great importance to illustration, by the need of \
which the relative length of articles, and our manner of expressing \
ourselves on every page, are governed, we are merely acting, with the \
exaggeration imposed on us by our limited space, upon the principles \
of the O.E.D. That may be said to be the first dictionary for which \
the ideal procedure has been possible, that is, the approaching of \
each article with an open mind and a collection of examples large \
enough to be exhaustive, and the extraction from these of classified \
senses \'97 the first dictionary, to put it another way, in which quota- \
tions have served not merely to adorn or convince, but as the \
indispensable raw material. This procedure \'97 first the collection of \
sentences from all possible sources as raw material, and then the \
independent classification \'97 we have often followed even in that \
part of our book (A \'97 R) in which the O.E.D. , with senses already \
classified and definitions provided, was before us, treating its articles \
rather as quarries to be drawn upon than as structures to be repro- \
duced in little ; and in the later part (S \'97 Z), where we had no longer \
the O.E.D. to depend upon, it has been our practice still more often; \
for many of the more difficult (i.e. especially the common and \
4 simple ') words, we have collected the quotations given in the best \
modern dictionaries (the Imperial, the Century, the Standard, \
Cassell's Encyclopaedic, Webster, &c), added to these what we \
could get either from other external sources or from our own heads, \
and then framed our articles, often without reference to the arrange- \
ment that we found in any of our authorities. Proceeding in this \
manner, it was almost inevitable that we should be very much alive \
to the inadequacy of mere definition and the need of constant illus- \
tration. That our examples have some general tendency to the \
colloquial, and include many usages for which room has not been \
found in dictionaries many times as large as this, is in harmony \
with our design of on the one hand restricting ourselves for the \
most part to current English, and on the other hand omitting \
nothing to which that description may fairly be applied. \
\
VOCABULARY \
\
The words, or senses of words, given are meant to be such only \
as are current ; ' current ', however, is an elastic term ; we might, \
but we do not, stretch it to include all words and senses used by \
Shakspere or in the Bible, on the ground that the whole of Shak- \
spere and the whole of the Bible are still commonly read ; thus the \
\
\
\
PREFACE \
\
\
\
archaic senses of addition (title), buxom (pliant), owe (own), sad \
(serious), sort (suit), and the archaic words shend (scold), wood \
(mad), familiar as they are to readers of Elizabethan literature, are \
not given. We do stretch it to include many words and senses that \
are fossilized, having in themselves no life or capacity for further \
development, but kept extant by being enshrined in perhaps a single \
proverb or phrase that is still in use ; of this sort are coil (confusion), \
preserved by 'shuffled off this mortal coil', and scotch (wound), \
preserved by ' we have scotched the snake, not killed it '. \
\
Again, of the many thousands of old or new scientific and \
technical terms that have a limited currency some are carried by \
accident into the main stream of the language and become known \
temporarily or permanently, vaguely or precisely, to all ordinarily \
well-informed members of the modern newspaper-reading public. \
For the purposes of a dictionary that is not to be bulky and yet is to \
give a fuller treatment than is usual in dictionaries of its size to the \
undoubtedly current words forming the staple of the language, \
selection among these intruders is a difficult but very necessary \
task. The most that can be hoped for is that every one conversant \
with any special vocabulary may consider us, though sadly deficient \
on his subject, fairly copious on others ; the meaning of many \
learned words that have been omitted as having no pretence to \
general currency may easily be gathered by reference first to the \
stem, which is often the subject of an article, or to another word of \
which the stem is clearly the same, and secondly to the suffix. \
\
In another class of words and senses the test of currency has led \
us to diverge in the opposite direction from the practice usual in \
dictionaries of this size ; if we give fewer scientific and technical \
terms, we admit colloquial, facetious, slang, and vulgar expressions \
with freedom, merely attaching a cautionary label ; when a well- \
established usage of this kind is omitted, it is not because we \
consider it beneath the dignity of lexicography to record it, but \
because, not being recorded in the dictionaries from which our \
word-list is necessarily compiled, it has escaped our notice ; we have \
not, however, consulted slang dictionaries nor made any attempt at \
completeness in this respect. \
\
SPELLING \
\
The spelling adopted is for the most part, but not invariably, that \
of the O.E.D. For instance, the verbs that contain the suffix -ize \
(which see), and their derivatives in -ization &c, are all given \
without the alternative forms in -ise &c, although these are still \
the commoner in British (as opposed to American) printing ; but \
such generally established spellings as judgment, rhyme, axe, have \
\
\
\
vi PREFACE \
\
\
\
not been excluded in favour of the judgement, rime, ax, preferred by \
the O.E.D., but are retained at least as alternatives having the right \
to exist. In dealing with verbs such as level, rivet, bias, whose \
parts and derivatives are variously spelt, the final consonant being \
often doubled with no phonetic or other significance, we have as far \
as possible fallen in with the present tendency, which is to drop the \
useless letter, but stopped short of recognizing forms that at present \
strike every reader as Americanisms; thus we write riveted, riveter, \
but not traveling, traveler. On another point of varying usage \'97 \
the insertion of a mute e in derivatives in -able, -age, -ish, &c, to \
indicate the 'long' sound of the stem vowel (likable or likeable, \
milage or mileage, latish or lateish) \'97 we have thought ourselves \
justified in taking a bolder line, and have consistently omitted the \
-e- ; it is against all analogy (or why not smileing, Romeish, doteage, \
tideal, indescribeable, desireable, exciteable ?), it is used chiefly in \
words not familiar or important enough to have their form respected \
as established, it obscures the different and more valuable use by \
which a soft g or c is indicated as in manageable and serviceable, and \
it tempts bad spellers to such monstrosities as unpalateable, loveable, \
and moveable. In words of the type ardour, colour, favour, where \
the O.E.D. recognizes both -our and -or, we have excluded the \
latter as being (except in particular words like horror and torpor, in \
which it is usually the only form) entirely non- British. Words in \
which -y- has intruded itself without completely dispossessing a \
more correct -i-, as sylvan, tyro, tyre, we have given with the -i- \
form either alone or placed first. In stating the plural of words in \
-o, we have found it impossible to draw any satisfactory line \
between the words that prefer -os and those that prefer -oes ; it may \
perhaps be laid down that on the one hand words of which the \
plural is very commonly used, as potato, have almost invariably \
-oes, and on the other hand words still felt to be foreign or of \
abnormal form, as soprano, chromo for chromolithograph, have \
almost invariably -os ; of many other words it may be said with \
confidence that they use one form only (cf . punctilios, noes) ; but \
the majority fluctuate, and we have not seen our way to doing \
otherwise. We have also to admit that after trying hard at an \
early stage to arrive at some principle that should teach us when to \
separate, when to hyphen, and when to unite the parts of com- \
pound words, we had to abandon the attempt as hopeless, and \
welter in the prevailing chaos. \

\
PRONUNCIATION \
\
When the pronunciation of a word is not sufficiently determined \
by the placing of the stress-mark or by vowel quantities, further \
information follows in round brackets. The phonetic values of the \
letters employed in these, and the use of the stress-mark, are \
explained on the page facing the letter A. \
\
Derivatives are to be understood, unless the contraiy is indicated, \
as following the pronunciation of the main word under which they \
are given or to which they are referred in the etymological note. \
\
The pronunciation of many words is omitted on the assumption \
that the reader is already familiar with the normal values of some \
letters and combinations. The hard sounds of th and s, and the \
sounds of c (s) and g (3) before i, e, and y, are recorded only for \
special purposes; a vowel that is short before two consonants or \
a single final consonant, or long before a single consonant followed \
by e mute, is not usually marked; and the pronunciation of the \
suffix -ation (-ashn) and of the a in path &c. (-ah-, -a-) is not given. \
\
To some suffixes no less familiar than -ation pronunciation is \
added in view of certain ignorant or pedantic tendencies. The \
pleasant fiction that cottage is pronounced kotaj, though still pre- \
valent in dictionaries, has perhaps never deceived any one; but \
we have all heard furniture (-tur), knowledge (no-), and often (-t-). \
Against these and other results of the undue influence of spelling \
warnings are freely given. \
\
In the choice or rejection of alternative pronunciations the O.E.D. \
has always been consulted, but is not always followed. \
\
ORDER OF SENSES \
\
From the order in which the senses of a word are here given no \
inference must be drawn as to their historical or other relations, the \
arrangement being freely varied according to the requirements or \
possibilities of the particular word. Sense- development cannot \
always be convincingly presented without abundant quotation from \
authorities, and the historical order is further precluded by the \
uniform omission of obsolete senses. Occasionally, when a rare but \
still current sense throws light on the commoner senses that follow \
or forms the connecting link with the etymology, it has been placed \
at the beginning ; but more commonly the order adopted has been \
that of logical connexion or of comparative familiarity or im- \
portance. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
ETYMOLOGY \
\
Etymology is given in square brackets at the 3nd of each article. \
\
Words of Teutonic origin are illustrated by all or some of the \
forms found in cognate languages. With words that have passed \
through several languages on their way to English, the forms taken \
in successive languages are recorded in full, with the following \
exceptions. (1) When OF or the like at the beginning of the etymo- \
logy is not followed by the old French form written in full, it is \
because the latter is identical in spelling with the English or differs \
from it only in some unimportant detail specified in brackets. \
(2) The Latin form of a Greek word is usually omitted, and is to be \
inferred according to the rules of transliteration given below. Thus \
(under pleonasm) ' f . L f . Gk pleonasmos ' is to be read ' f . L \
pleonasmus f. Gk pleonasmos\\ A similar omission of a word in \
any other language implies absolute identity of form. \
\
Greek words are written with the corresponding English letters \
($> X' +> Pi pp\\=P n > kh, ps, rh, rrh, and a, tj, w,=ai, ei, 6i), and not \
according to the Latin transliteration, the rules for which are as \
follows: Greek k= Latin c; ai=ae; ou=u; u (exc. in diphthongs) \
= y ; ei = i or e ; oi = oe (but in nom. pi. = i) ; g (before g or k) = n ; also, \
-6s (nom. masc), -6n,=\'b1-us, -um; -es, -e, (1st decl. nom.)=-a; -on \
(nom.)=-o; -6s (genit.) = -is; -a (accus. sing. masc. or fern. ) = -em. \
\
French nouns of Latin origin are with few exceptions derived \
from the Latin accusative ; but the Latin nominative is here given \
except when (e.g. in words in -atio) a change of stress is involved. \
\
Greek i\\ (e) and w (6), and the e of Latin infinitives of 2nd conj. \
(-ere, -eri), are regularly marked long. The accented letters (a, sb, \
&c.) in forms quoted from Old English or other Teutonic languages \
are long. \
\
F, G, &c, must not be taken to imply that the word to which \
they are prefixed is current, or is so spelt, in the modern language ; \
nor does it follow from a word's being given as OF that it is obsolete. \
\
The etymology often contains references in small capitals to \
words and suffixes. \
\
Hence introduces one or more of the direct derivatives of the word \
treated ; whence introduces such derivatives under a particular sense \
to which they are restricted ; so introduces words derived from \
another language ; hence or cogn. , whence or cogn. , introduce groups \
of partly English and partly foreign derivation. The suffixes of \
such derivatives are commonly printed in small capitals, and are \
thus referred to the suffix article in its alphabetical place. The \
numbers enclosed in brackets indicate subdivisions of the suffix \
\
\
\
PREFACE ix \
\
article, and are often used to distinguish among the possible senses \
of the derivative word those in which it is chiefly current. \
\
The first element of a Latin or other compound word is .often \
referred to a prefix article, and the remainder treated separately \
within brackets; meanings given within the bracket belong to the \
simple word, those of the compound being added if necessaiy outside \
it. Thus convene is [f. F convenir f. L C0T$(venire vent- come) \
assemble, agree, fit]. The stem vent- and the senses agree, fit, are \
here added for the purposes of convention and convenience, which \
are referred to convene. The first element of a Greek compound \
similarly treated is sometimes written according to the current \
(Latin) transliteration, to facilitate reference to the prefix article; \
Greek kakoepeia, under cacoepy, accordingly appears as CACO\{epeia). \
Certain similar devices for saving needless repetition will, it is \
believed, explain themselves. \
\
The etymology of all words from A to R was drawn in the first \
instance from the O.E.D., but was occasionally modified after \
reference to Prof. Skeat's Etymological Dictionary (Clarendon \
Press, 4th edition, 1910). From S to Z Prof. Skeat's work has \
been our main authority, the Century and other dictionaries being \
consulted for the words that he omits. \
\
\
\
REFERENCE BY SMALL CAPITALS \
\
The use of small capitals for etymological purposes is explained \
above. \
In the same way reference is made \
\
(1) from the word treated to another word for the purpose of \
contrast, distinction, correlation, or the like. Of this kind are the \
references from slander to libel and scandal, from creationism to \
evolution and vice versa, and from tenon to mortise and vice versa. \
\
(2) from any member of a group to the word under which the \
group is collected or further explained. Ruby (print.) is in this \
way referred to type ; order (nat. hist.) to class 1 ; and the iron 1 , \
golden, and silver ages to brazen \\ \
\
(3) from one or more words of a proverb or the like to that under \
which alone the proverb is explained. Play l and drake 2 contain \
such references to duck l , flesh and herring to fish \\ \
\
(4) from a compound of the word treated to its other component \
for explanation. The sign ( = ) prefixed to such a reference indicates \
that the simple word treated is itself used in the sense of the com- \
pound. Thus, under pie 1 , sea-pie is merely referred (sea.-j>.) to sea, \
but magpie, besides being referred to the article magpie, is recorded \
(= magpie) as one of the senses of pie. \
\
\
\
PREFACE \
\
\
\
ABBREVIATIONS \
\
In any article, when the word treated in it is to be quoted or \
mentioned, its initial letter followed by a period is used instead \
of the whole word ; this stands only for the exact form that heads \
the article ; e.g., in the verb love, I. means love (verb or noun), \
but not loving, loved, &c. ; the plural of nouns is represented by \
doubling the letter ; e.g., in extreme, nut, ee., nn., mean extremes, \
nuts ; in the part of an article obviously restricted to a derivative \
the letter may stand for that derivative ; e.g., representation, given \
in the article represent, is followed by a bracket in which r. stands \
not for represent, but for representation ; in the part of an article \
restricted to a compound, the hyphened initials of the two parts are \
used ; e.g., when in doing ground-floor under the article ground the \
phrase get in on the ground-floor is to be explained in a bracket, \
g.-f. is used for ground-floor. \
\
Of other abbreviations, a list including all that are not either too \
obvious to need explanation or generally current (and accordingly \
to be found in the abbreviation lists given in the first article of each \
letter of the alphabet) follows on the opposite page. In this list, \
three points require mention : (1) the appending of &c. means that \
the abbreviation stands for derivatives or inflexions as well as for \
the simple word given ; e.g., metaphor &c. means metaphor, meta- \
phorical, or metaphorically ; explain &c. means explain, explains, \
explained, explaining, or explanation ; this system is used also with \
abbreviations omitted as obvious ; thus adv. stands not only for \
adverb, but also for adverbial and adverbially ; (2) abbreviations of \
nouns, such as ex. (example), prep, (preposition), are often used \
with the last letter doubled (exx.,prepp.) as plurals ; it has not been \
thought necessary to give these plural forms except in one-letter \
abbreviations (aa., nn.); similar plurals occur for forms that have \
been omitted as obvious iadjj. for adjectives &c); (3) abbreviations \
given in the list with initial capital have always the capital in use ; \
but those given with initial small letter have either form according \
to circumstances ; similarly, though the list is all in Roman type, \
the abbreviations are sometimes for reasons not affecting their sense \
printed in italics. \

NOTE ON ACCENT, PRONUNCIATION, INFLEXION, AND \
\
FOREIGN WORDS \
\
ACCENT \
\
Accent is marked by the turned period ("), which is normally placed after the \
accented vowel or diphthong (a'etop, allow, a'ccent noun, acce'nt verb, exag- \
gepa'tion, exa*g , g , epatop) ; two equal accents in one word are both marked (ti*tbi*t) ; \
and the 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0  is used for the secondary as well as for the main accent in long words where \
the former might be doubtful (cir'eumgypa'te, a*biogene*tieally). \
\
But the place of the turned period in syllables whose vowel sound is modified by r or \
re is after the whole combination (por'ter, pupe'ly), any possible confusion being \
guarded against by the - or ^ (mere'ly, but hepe'tieal). Similarly it stands after \
silent consonants (migh'ty, deb'top, blaek'guard), consonants that merely modify \
a vowel sound (eal'mness), or e mute following the accented vowel (blue'bell). \
\
Some miscellaneous examples are added :\'97 fo'rest, fore'noon, for'tnight, fore'nsic ; \
bar'ring, ba Track; bal'my, ba'lsam ; arraig'n ; demes'ne ; sig'ning, si'gnature; high'er; \
Cadme'an; defray; bye'-law; da"ffadowndi*lly ; ca'noniza'tion. \
\
PRONUNCIATION \
\
When necessary, a bracket is placed immediately after a word, with directions for \
pronouncing it or some part of it. In these brackets, \
\
(1) Vowel sounds have the value shown by the roman-type letters in :\'97 mate, mete, \
viite, mote, mute, moot ; rack, reck, rick, rock, ruck, rook ; caw, cow ; bah, boil. \
\
(2) Vowel-combinations with r (the r is not trilled before a consonant or mute e) are \
as follows :\'97 \
\
wiare, mere, mire, move, demure, moor ; dowry ; part, pert, port. \
\
(3) Italicized vowels or vowel-combinations have the indistinct sound shown in \
again, moment, admiral, morose, support, certain, connoisseur, comfort, jealous, murder. \
\
(4) Each consonant or consonant-combination has only one sound; the value of \
ambiguous or specially used ones is :\'97 \
\
eh as in loch ; dh as iwdhen ( = then) ; g" as in get ; jasin./e\'a3; x\\g a.sin singer ; ngg \
anin finger ; n-g" as in un-gardid (=unguarded) ; p as in rat (and see vowel-combina- \
tions above) ; s as in sister ; th as in thinketh ; tsh as in tship (=chip) ; w as in wit (and \
see vowel sounds above) ; y as in yet ; zh as in fuzhn (=fusion). \
\
Letters marked - or w# in the word itself have the same value as in the brackets, \
except that e is also used, when there is no danger of confusion, to show that e is not \
mute or part of a compound sound ; so ni"cety, ca'ffeine. \
\
INFLEXION \
\
The rules assumed, exceptions to which are noted in a bracket placed after a word's \
grammatical description, are as follows :\'97 \
\
1. Verbs add -s in 3rd sing, pres., -ed in past and p.p., -ing in pres. part., -er to form \
agent-noun. \
\
2. Verbs and adjectives drop final mute e before -ing, -ed, -er, -est. \
\
3. Before -ed, -ing, -er, -est, -eth, monosyllabic verbs and adjectives double a final \
single consonant (except x) if preceded by a single vowel. \
\
4. (a) nouns, (b) adjectives, (c) verbs, in -y preceded by a consonant have (a) plural \
-ies, (b) comparative -ier, superlative -iest, adverb -ily, noun -iness, (c) 3rd sing. pres. \
-ies, past and p.p. -ied, agent-noun -ier. \
\
5. Nouns in -s, -x, -z, -ch = tsh, and -sh, and some in -o, form plural by adding -es ; \
others add -s. \
\
6. Monosyllabic adjectives and disyllables in -y compare in -er, -est ; others with \
more, most. \
\
FOREIGN WORDS \
\
Words usually or often printed in italics as either incompletely naturalized or com- \
pletely foreign are in sloping type. When either the word itself or any of its sounds \
is distinctly un-English, the reader is warned by a bracket containing, instead of pro- \
nunciation, the letter or letters standing for the language it belongs to. Otherwise, \
pronunciation is given for sloped words to the same extent as for others, but is often \
to be taken as merely approximate. \
